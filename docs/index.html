The data collected was on traffic accidents in forty-nine states in the US and filtered for only traffic accidents in the state of Washington. Data dates range from February 2016 to December 2019 and was aggregated via mainly two API's, MapQuest and Bing, which obtained data reported from federal and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors. The data displayed on the above map are placed based on the longitude and latitude coordinates of the accident and can be interactively filtered, via the sliders, on the time of day and temperature with the colors indicating the severity of the traffic accident (four being the worst severity, determined by the impact on traffic). </p> <h1>Write-Up</h1> <p> We were interested in the severity of accidents with the U.S. Initially we started out with a dataset that contained accidents within all U.S. states. The first part of the process included all team members exploring the dataset. In exploring the dataset, we found visualizations with geographical mapping to be particularly effective in exploring trends within states and counties. For example, trends in severity between eastern or western regions or different geographical locations can easily be seen on a map versus a bar chart of states or counties. We eventually decided to narrow in the focus to Washington. We wanted to allow users to explore their own questions concerning how temperature and time played into the severity of the accident at the county level especially with a geographical region that people were familiar with. By narrowing down the region to Washington, user’s could see more specific information by county. For example, we noticed that King’s County tends to have more accidents than other regions of Washington. </p> <p> We used color to encode the severity of the accident. Here we decided to use yellow, orange, and red to indicate severity from 2 to 4 respectively. We decided color would be a good encoding of severity because users already associate red with negativity, yellow with happiness, and orange as color in between. We thought dots with different colors to indicate data points would be easier to distinguish rather than shape, orientation, or other variables. While we thought size would be easy to distinguish different data points, we thought varying the size would lead to too much overlap into data points and cluttering the visualization. Additionally, we added sliders to fit our original intentions of having the users be able to explore their own questions by being able to filter temperature and time. Because both temperature and time have a scale of values, we thought a slider would be more appropriate than a radio button or selection. Additionally, we wanted to keep temperature. </p> <p> We all started by exploring the data and developing questions by using Tableau to visualize different variables. Through this, we all decided on looking at the severity of accidents within Washington and that we wanted users to be able to filter by time and temperature. By far the most time consuming parts, were being able to display the map and being able to filter by time and temperature. McKinnon, Nicole, and Kwing looked into the map visualization. Anika and McKinnon looked into filtering the data and adding sliders. Kwing and Anika looked into changing the formatting (font, color, aesthetics). Anika did the write-up. Each member of the team spent around 8-10 hours individually creating the visualization much of this time was spent in familiarizing ourselves with D3, JavaScript, CSS and HTML. </p> </div>
