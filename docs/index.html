The data collected was on traffic accidents in forty-nine states in the US and filtered for only traffic accidents in the state of Washington. Data dates range from February 2016 to December 2019 and was aggregated via mainly two API's, MapQuest and Bing, which obtained data reported from federal and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors. The data displayed on the above map are based on the longitude and latitude coordinates and can be interactively filtered, via the sliders, on the time of day and temperature with the colors indicating the severity of the traffic accident. </p> <h1>Write-Up</h1> <p> A rationale for your design decisions. How did you choose your particular visual encodings and interaction techniques? What alternatives did you consider and how did you arrive at your ultimate choices? </p> <p> An overview of your development process. Describe how the work was split among the team members. Include a commentary on the development process, including answers to the following questions: Roughly how much time did you spend developing your application (in people-hours)? What aspects took the most time? </p> </div>
